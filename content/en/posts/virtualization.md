> Sharing a common development environment with everyone on your team

Virtualization:: abstraction layer which make a s/w (like OS) installed on shared h/w
as if its native and completely isolated from other s/w apps.

Virtualization saved cost and reuse hardware infrastructure.

Types of virtualization

* Server virtualization + total isolation
  * Type 1 - Hypervisor runs as native
    * **KVM** Kernel-Based Virtual Machine
    * VMware ESX,
    * Citrix XenServer
    * Microsoft’s Hyper-V.
  * Type 2 - Hypervisor runs on top of OS
    * Oracle virtualbox
    * VMware Workstation
    * SWSoft’s Parallels Desktop.
    * LinuX Containers (LXC)/Docker
      * they dont require a full-fledged guest OS like virtual machines
* Network virtualization
* Storage virtualization
* Service/ Application virtualization

### Blacklisting a hypervisor 

```
lsmod | grep -i kvm
echo 'blacklist kvm-intel' >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

# Virtualbox Guest Additions
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential dkms
```

## Vagrant

- the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines.
- script the virtual machine configuration as well as the provisioning

Base images like *bento* are important to have clean slate starting point.

> "don't use vagrant in production" : vagrant boxes are built with security holes in it to allow smooth scripting/ssh/tunnelling/sudo (no passphrase, known password : vagrant).

Vagrant File sections and structure

1. section
2. provider
   1. [X] virtualbox
   2. Hyper-V
   3. [!] docker
      1. doesnt require `config.vm.box` section
3. provision
   1. Ansible

- Start with uncluttered basebox, install apps on top of and then package it to be reused

```
# List all intalled vagratn boxes
vagrant box list 
```

#### FAQ

> Is it possible to pass values from command line to Vagrant File?

You cannot pass any parameter to vagrant. The only way is to use environment variables
```
MY_VAR='my value'
vagrant up
```

And use `ENV['MY_VAR']` in recipe.

> What exactly does `vagrant snapshot` save ?

Vagrant snapshots just call the provider "snapshots" method. So Vagrant snapshot on virtualbox just calls virtualbox snapshot.



### Packer

- Builder builds an OS image for various environments like
  - AWS
  - Azure
  - DigitalOcean
  - Docker
  - Hyper-V
  - LXC
  - OpenStack
  - Parallels
  - QEMU
  - VirtualBox
  - VMware
- **The Template** contains instructions in simple JSON format
- Packer only builds images. It does not attempt to manage them in any way
- The real utility of Packer comes from being able to install and configure software into the images as well, provision step.
- *shell* provisioner to install user apps and packages
- cmdline tools fits nicely in continuous delivery pipeline
- consistent images for multiple platforms in parallel,

```
{
  "builders": ["..."],
  "provisioners": ["..."],
  "post-processors": ["vagrant"]
}
```

## Docker

- uses kernel **cgroup** and **namespacing** via **LXC**.
- `Boot2Docker` (minimal OS that can run Docker).

1. Can I build linux from source and run it from virtualbox?
2. Virtualbox can run ISO images, how to get ISO from compiled linux kernel?
