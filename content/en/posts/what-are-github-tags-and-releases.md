Before getting deeper in to git tags, lets first understand the
basics information provided by a software package to its users.

#### Components of a release

* release notes and
* a packaged software bundle or binaries

### What are git tags exactly and why need them?

[Git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) are specific points
in the history of your repository, which you might want to rollback in case anything bad happens.

Usually git commit trees grow long very quickly and it might be daunting to remember the
goog commit from the bad ones. Thats where git tags comes in handy and they are excellent in
labelling the **commits of interest**

Versions in Github are based on Git tags




### How to we tag out git commit tree?

A good and standard approach is to follow the **Version Semantics scheme**
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```
where,

> MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,

> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and

> PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

> Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

### How to add tags to repositories?

Tags could be easily added to git worktree using following commands:
```
// syntax format
git tag -a <tagname> -m <tag short description>

// example
git tag -a v0.5 -m "Release 0.5 with updated search API"

// view all tags
git tag -l

// dealing with remote tags on Github
git push origin <tag name>
git push origin v0.5
git push --tags
```

git tag command other switches
> **-a** add tag

> **-l** list tags

> **-d** delete tag


[NOTE] you cannot checkout tags in git BUT you can create a branch from a tags

```
git checkout -b <branchname> <tagname>
```

#### creating tags from previous commits
```
git tag <tagname> <commitreference>
```
